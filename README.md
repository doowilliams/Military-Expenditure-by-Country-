# Military-Expenditure-by-Country-

This project is focused on analyzing military expenditure data from the World Bank's database. The data includes information on military spending for various countries from 1988 to 2018. The goal of the project is to gain insights on global military expenditure trends over time and across different regions.

We first loaded the data into a pandas dataframe and performed some initial data cleaning tasks such as renaming columns, removing missing values and converting the data types. We then created a line plot to visualize(using Matplotlib) the total military expenditure for all countries over time. We observed that overall military expenditure has been increasing over time, with a spike in the early 2000s.

 We further analyzed the data by grouping countries into different regions of the world, such as Africa, Asia & Oceania, America and Caribbean, Europe and Middle East. We created a new dataframe that summed up military expenditure for each region by year. We then created a line plot and box plot to compare military expenditure across the regions. We also used pairplot to show the relationship of all data, and a linear regression model to predict Africa's military expenditure in 2022.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of global military expenditure trends over time and across different regions. It highlights that military expenditure has been increasing over time and also shows the difference in expenditure across different regions. It also uses Linear Regression model to predict, python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.
